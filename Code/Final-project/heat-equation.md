Introduction
------------

Consider the following initial boundary value problem:

```math
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\alpha\Delta u = 0 \quad \text{on }\Omega,
```
```math
u(\vec{x},t)=0 \quad \forall \vec{x}\in\partial\Omega,
```
```math
u(\vec{x},0)=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\sin(\pi x_k)\quad \forall \vec{x}\in\Omega
```
where $`n`$ is the number of dimensions of the domain, $`\Omega = [0,1]^n`$ is the domain
(the unit square in 2D or the unit cube in 3D), $`\partial\Omega`$ is the boundary of the
domain, $`u`$ is the temperature as a function of space $`\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n`$ and time $`t`$ and
$`\Delta`$ is the [Laplace operator], in an $`n`$-dimensional space given by
```math
\Delta := \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_k^2}
```
The exact solution to above initial boundary value problem is given by
```math
u(\vec{x},t)=e^{-n\pi^2\alpha t}\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\sin(\pi x_k)=e^{-n\pi^2\alpha t}u(x,0)
```

We are going to apply a finite difference discretisation. We create a mesh of
$`m^n`$ equidistant interior nodes, $`m`$ nodes per dimension, hence the distance
between two nodes is $`\Delta x = 1/(m+1)`$.  All nodes are labeled from $`0`$ to $`m^n`$
(excluding) such that node $`j+1`$ is the neighbour of node $`j`$ in dimension $`0`$,
node $`j+m`$ is the neighbour of node $`j`$ in dimension $`1`$, and in general, node
$`j+m^k`$ is the neighbour of node $`j`$ in dimension $`k`$.  The following
illustrates a two-dimensional mesh with $`m=3`$:

Approximating the [Laplace operator] with a second order central [finite
difference] discretisation and the remaining semi-discrete differential equation
with the [Backward Euler method] gives the following system of equations
```math
Mw_{l+1}=w_l
```

where vector $`w_l \in\mathbb{R}^{m^n}`$ is the discrete approximation of the heat $`u`$ at time
$`t=l \Delta t`$, with vector component $`i`$ refering to node $`i`$.  The matrix $`M`$ is
given by
```math
M_{ij} = I_{ij}-\alpha\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}D_{kij}\quad\forall i,j \in \{ 0,1,...,m^n\}
```


where $`I`$ is the identity matrix and $`D_k`$ is the discrete approximation of the
second order derivative in dimension $`k \in \{0,1,...,n-1\}`$:
```math
D_{kij}=-2\quad \text{if } j=i
```
```math
D_{kij}=1\quad \text{if } j \text{ is a left neighbour of } i \text{ in dimension }k
```
```math
D_{kij}=1\quad \text{if } j \text{ is a right neighbour of } i \text{ in dimension }k
```

**Note:** Not all nodes have left or right neighbours in every dimension.  In
the example mesh given above node $`0`$ has only right neighbours: node $`1`$ in
dimension $`0`$ and node $`3`$ in dimension $`1`$.  Node $`5`$ has two left
neighbours (node $`4`$ in dimension $`0`$ and node $`2`$ in dimension $`1`$), but only
one right neighbour: node $`8`$ in dimension $`1`$.

Given a diffusion coefficient $`\alpha`$, a time step size $`\Delta t`$ and a number of points
$`m`$ the following prodedure can be used to obtain the numerical solution at time
$`t`$, which should be a multiple of $`\Delta t`$:

1.  Create the initial solution vector `w_0` by sampling the initial condition
    $`u(\vec{x},0)`$ at the interior nodes:
    ```math
    w_{0i} = w(x_i,0).
    ```

2.  For $`l = 0,1,..., (t/\Delta t)-1`$: solve the following linear problem for
    $`w_{l+1}`$:
    ```math
    M w_{l+1} = w_l.
    ```

Part 1: Vector class
--------------------

Create a `template<typename T> class Vector` class with the following
functionality:

*   The element type of the `Vector` class is specified via a template
    parameter `T`.

*   The `Vector` class can be constructed in the following ways:

    *   a default constructor that sets the length to zero,

    *   a constructor that takes a length as an argument,

    *   a constructor that takes another `Vector` as an argument and copies the
        elements of the argument to this `Vector` and

    *   a constructor that takes an initialiser list representing the contents
        of this `Vector`.

*   The `Vector` supports the copy and move assignment operators.  It is
    allowed to change the length of the `Vector` upon assignment, e.g. given
    two `Vector`s `a` and `b`,

        Vector<int> a(5);
        Vector<int> b = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

    the following should be valid

        a = b;

*   The `Vector` class supports a pointwise sum and difference with another
    `Vector` via the binary operators `+` and `-`, respectively.  The element
    type of the resulting `Vector` is equal to the type of the pointwise
    operation.  If the `Vector`s have different lengths an exception should be
    thrown.

*   The `Vector` class supports left and right multiplication with a scalar.
    The element type of the resuling `Vector` is equal to the type of the
    pointwise multiplication.

Create a function `dot` that computes the [inner product] of two vectors.  The
function has the following signature:

    template<typename T>
    T dot(const Vector<T>& l, const Vector<T>& r)
    {
        ...
    }

[inner product]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product

Part 2: Matrix classes
----------------------

Implement a `template<typename T> Matrix` class template that represents a
sparse matrix.  The `Matrix` class has the following properties:

*   The shape of the `Matrix` can be passed via a constructor.

        Matrix<double> M(10, 20); // initialise M with 10 rows and 20 columns

    It is not allowed to change the shape afterwards.

*   Entries can be added in the following way:

        Matrix<double> M(10, 10)
        M[{0,0}] = 1.0; // set value at row 0, column 0 to 1.0
        M[{1,2}] = 2.0; // set value at row 1, column 2 to 2.0

*   The `Matrix` class has a `matvec` method that computes and returns the
    matrix-vector product with some vector.

**Hint:** You might want to use the `map` class template from the C++ standard
library, which provides an elegant way to handle arbitrary data (e.g., the
matrix entries) with a unique key value (e.g., the row/column position), and
use `array<int, 2>` as the map key type.

Part 3: Conjugate Gradient method
---------------------------------

Create a function named `cg` that solves a linear system using the [Conjugate
Gradient method], given in pseudocode by

    p_0 = r_0 = b - A x_0
    for k = 0, 1, ..., maxiter-1
        alpha_k = dot(r_k, r_k) / dot(A p_k, p_k)
        x_(k+1) = x_k + alpha_k p
        r_(k+1) = r_k - alpha_k A p
        if dot(r_(k+1), r_(k+1)) < tol*tol
            stop
        beta_k = dot(r_(k+1), r_(k+1)) / dot(r_k, r_k)
        p_(k+1) = r_(k+1) + beta_k p_k

Here, `A` is a symmetric positive definite matrix, `x_k`, `r_k` and `p_k` are
vectors, `dot` is the standard l2-inner product, `tol` is an absolute tolerance
for the residual and `maxiter` is the maximum allowed number of iterations.

The `cg` function should have the following signature

    template<typename T>
    int cg(
        const Matrix<T> &A, const Vector<T> &b, Vector<T> &x, T tol, I maxiter)
    {
        ...
    }

The third argument serves both as the initial guess (`x_0` in the pseudocode)
and as the result (`x_k+1` in the pseudocode, where `k` is the last iteration).
The function should return the number of iterations used to achieve the desired
tolerance if the Conjugate Gradient method converged within `maxiter`,
otherwise `-1`.

Part 4: Finite difference discretisation of the heat equation
-------------------------------------------------------------

Create a `class Heat1D` solver that represents the 1D initial boundary value
problem given above and has the following functionality:

*   The constructor should take three arguments: the diffusion coefficient
    `alpha`, the number of points per dimension `m` and the timestep `dt`.  The
    constructor should create the iteration matrix `M` given in the introduction
    and store the result as an attribute with type `Matrix<double>`.

*   The class has a method `Vector<double> exact(double t) const` that returns
    the exact solution at time `t` evaluated at all interior grid points.

*   The class has a method `Vector<double> solve(double t_end) const` that
    solves the initial boundary value problem given in the introduction using
    the procedure given at the end of the introduction until `t_end` and returns
    the numerical solution at the last time step.

Test your implementation by creating a solver with diffusion coefficient
`alpha=0.3125`, time step `dt=0.001` and `m=99`, solve the problem until `t=1`
and compare the numerical solution with the exact solution.  To verify the
matrix `M`, set `alpha=0.3125`, `dt=0.1`, `m=3` and compare with

    [ 2.0 -0.5     ]
    [-0.5  2.0 -0.5]
    [     -0.5  2.0]

All zero entries have been left out.

Create a `class Heat2D` solver that represents the 2D initial boundary value
problem given above with the same functionality as `Heat1D`.  Test your
implementation by creating a solver with diffusion coefficient `alpha=0.3125`,
time step `dt=0.001` and `m=99`, solve the problem until `t=0.5` and compare
the numerical solution with the exact solution.  To verify the matrix `M`, set
`alpha=0.3125`, `dt=0.1`, `m=3` and compare with

    [ 3.0 -0.5      -0.5                         ]
    [-0.5  3.0 -0.5      -0.5                    ]
    [     -0.5  3.0           -0.5               ]
    [-0.5            3.0 -0.5      -0.5          ]
    [     -0.5      -0.5  3.0 -0.5      -0.5     ]
    [          -0.5      -0.5  3.0           -0.5]
    [               -0.5            3.0 -0.5     ]
    [                    -0.5      -0.5  3.0 -0.5]
    [                         -0.5      -0.5  3.0]

If there is enough time create a `template<int n> class Heat` with the same
functionality as the `Heat1D` and `Heat2D` classes.  The template parameter `n`
specifies the number of dimensions of the problem.  Test your implementation for
one, two and three dimensions.
