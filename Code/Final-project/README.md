# TW3720TU: Final project

The aim of the final project is to practise the different concepts
taught in the course and to finally demonstrate the ability to apply
them in the context of a slightly larger code.

Please choose one final project from this list

* [heat equation]


## Design criteria

As stated throughout the lecture, the is no single solution but
different ways to implement the final project. However, you should
review the different concepts taught in the course and apply them to
design a code that

*   is easy to read and to maintain
*   is efficient and well structures
*   does not contain unneccessary code duplication
*   makes use of features from the C++ standard library

## Submission

Final projects can be worked on either individually or (preferrably!)
in groups of 2-3 students and submitted via BrightSpace. Please submit
your work ONLY ONCE under the name of one group member and indicate

*    student numbers
*    student names

of all group members. You submission must contain

*   a ZIP file with all source code, CMake, etc. files required to build your final project and
*   a short report on your final project.

The report must include

*   a short description of the design of your implementation (e.g., explain the class structure, why you chose a particular implementation, etc.)
*   a test section demonstrating the correctness of your implementation
*   the source code as an appendix

Submission deadline is 20/04/2018.

## Grading criteria

The final project (code + report) will be graded as follows:

### Source code

*   0 points: not submitted, submitted but code does not compile, code
    has nothing to do with the assignment/all results wrong
*   1 point: code compiles and produces correct results but is
    implemented against all rules
*   2 points: code compiles, produces correct results and basically
    follows the aim of the assignment, but with quite frequent
    'inconsistencies' (e.g., consistent use of passing arguments by
    value even if passing arguments by constant reference is
    advisable). A single occurance of this is not considered 'frequent'.
*   3 points: premium code

### Report

*   0 points: no report submitted
*   1 point:  report lacks significant parts of the description and/or testing section
*   2 points: premium report
