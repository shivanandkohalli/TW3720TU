# TW3720TU: FAQ.md


1.  **Where do I find the course material?**
    All course material is available online at:
    [https://gitlab.com/mmoelle1/tw3720tu.2017](https://gitlab.com/mmoelle1/tw3720tu.2017).


2.  **Where can I ask questions about the content and homework assignments?**
    There will be assistants during the lab sessions on Thursday
    13:45-17:30 who will answer your questions concerning the
    lecture content and the practical homework assignments.
    Questions via email will **not** be answered.

3.  **Are the lab sessions and/or the lectures mandatory?**
    No, neither the lab sessions nor the lectures are
    mandatory. See 2 about getting help?

4.  **Can I use my own computer and/or work on the assignments from home?**
    Yes, but then you are on your own. We cannot provide support in
    installing the required software and/or solving problems that
    result from using tools and compilers other than those installed
    in the computer rooms at IO.

5.  **How can I submit the homework assignments?**
    Homework assignments must be submitted in the following way: Login
    to one of the PCs in the computer room and download and
    configure the codes as described in the "Getting started"
    tutorial.
    
    Consider the first homework assignment `H01-swap`. Once you have
    written the code in the file `H01-swap/src/swap.cxx` compile it by
    running
    ```
    make swap
    ```
    and check if it works correctly by running
    ```
    ./H01-swap/swap
    ```
    Once you are satisfied with the result run
    ```
    make swap_assignment
    ```
    This will produce the file `swap.log`.
    To submit your homework assignment upload the file `swap.log` to the 
    `Assignment Submission Folder` named `H01-swap` in BrightSpace.

6.  **I compiled the assingments using other tools/compilers. Can I
    hand in the assignments in another way.**

    No, see 5.
