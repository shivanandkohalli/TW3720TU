Homework 2: Array
=================

Write a C++ program starting from the code template
[src/arrays.cxx](src/arrays.cxx) that does the following tasks:

1.  Read two integer values `n1` and `n2` from keayboard using
    input-streams.

2.  Allocate two integer arrays of size `n1` and `n2`, respectively.

3.  Read integer values from keyboard to initialise the two arrays.

4.  Write an add-function that adds the two arrays and returns the
    result as a new integer array. Decide on your own how you want to
    pass arguments.

5.  Test your implementation of the add-function for different input
    values by writing the resulting array to the standard output
    stream.

Verify that your program works correctly!

Think big (what happens if `n1` is 1.000.000)!

Think fail-safe (what happens of `n1` and `n2` are not equal)!
